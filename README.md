# Proposolve

A simple proof-of-concept truth table generator for logical propositions.

Proposolve supports order of operations, parenthesis, seven operators, and up to 26 variables (lowercase letters from "a" to "z").

Not all operators have been tested sufficiently to guarantee all inputs will produce the correct outputs, and the underlying algorithm is still likely inefficient as this is solely a proof-of-concept experiment.
